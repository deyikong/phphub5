# Processes script arguments to ensure that the Docker container can access references files or directories
#
# This script will iterate over all of the arguments passed to the script and determine if any of them reference files
# or directories.
#
# If the arg references a file or directory, the script will ensure that the path is a fully qualified path
# (by converting a relative path to a fully qualified one)
#
# After ensuring the path is a fully qualified path, this script will compare the path with $WORKING_DIR, and if the
# path is contained within $WORKING_DIR, then the path will be modified to be a relative path in relation to
# $WORKING_DIR
#
# If the path is NOT contained within the $WORKING_DIR, then the dirname of the path will be mounted into the container
# as a volume.
